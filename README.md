**Quick answers** (starting points, not absolute rankings — the right choice depends on your constraints):

- **Which framework?** LangGraph for complex stateful agents, LlamaIndex for data-heavy indexing, Haystack for auditable enterprise pipelines, LangChain for rapid prototyping.
- **Which vector database?** pgvector if you already run PostgreSQL, Qdrant for strong filtering under ~50M vectors, Milvus to scale toward billions, Pinecone for zero-ops serverless.
- **Which embedding model?** Fine-tune for a domain corpus; otherwise BGE-M3 (open) or OpenAI text-embedding-3-large (managed) — always index and query with the same model.
- **Do I need a reranker?** Yes when precision matters: Cohere Rerank (managed API), BGE-Reranker v2-m3 (best self-hosted), or FlashRank (CPU / serverless).
- **How should I chunk?** Start with recursive splitting at 256–512 tokens, then move to semantic or document-type-aware chunking if retrieval quality lags.

## Reference Architectures

Stop guessing. Here are three battle-tested stacks for different stages of
maturity.

### 1. The Local / Dev Stack (Zero to One)

**Goal:** Rapid prototyping, zero cost, no API keys.

**Stack:**

- **LLM:** **Ollama** (LLaMA 3 / Mistral)
- **Vector DB:** **Chroma** (Embedded)
- **Eval:** **Ragas** (Basic checks)

**Why:** Runs entirely on your laptop. Perfect for "Hello World" and checking
feasibility.

**Risks:** High latency; performance depends on your hardware; no horizontal
scaling.

**Observability Checklist:** `print()` statements and basic logging.

*Public latency / cost envelope: No public end-to-end benchmark for this stack
combination — performance is entirely hardware-dependent. Component-level
data: see [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#1-vector-databases) (Chroma) and
[benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#9-gaps--not-publicly-measured).*

### 2. The Mid-Scale / Production Stack (Speed to Market)

**Goal:** High precision, developer velocity, minimal infra management.

**Stack:**

- **Vector DB:** **Qdrant** or **Weaviate** (Cloud/Managed)
- **Reranker:** **Cohere Rerank** (API)
- **Tracing:** **Langfuse** or **Arize Phoenix**

**Why:** Offloads complexity to managed services. "It just works" with great documentation.

**Risks:** Costs scale linearly with usage; dependency on external APIs (Vendor
lock-in).

**Observability Checklist:** Latency tracking, Token usage costs, Trace
visualization.

*Public latency / cost envelope: No public end-to-end benchmark for this exact
stack combination. Component-level data available: Qdrant self-published
benchmarks [\[V\]](benchmarks.md#1-vector-databases), Anthropic / OpenAI caching
figures [\[V\]](benchmarks.md#4-caching-prompt--semantic). For reranking latency,
see [benchmarks.md § Gaps](benchmarks.md#9-gaps--not-publicly-measured).*

### 3. The Enterprise / High-Scale Stack (The 1%)

**Goal:** Throughput maximization, data sovereignty, full control.

**Stack:**

- **Vector DB:** **Milvus** (Distributed)
- **Serving:** **vLLM** (Self-hosted)
- **Eval (CI/CD):** **DeepEval**
- **Monitoring:** **OpenLIT** (OpenTelemetry)

**Why:** You own the data and the compute. Scales to billions of vectors.

**Risks:** Significant operational complexity (Kubernetes); requires a dedicated Platform Engineering team.

**Observability Checklist:** Distributed tracing, Embedding drift detection, Custom SLA alerts, GPU utilization metrics.

*Public latency / cost envelope: No public end-to-end benchmark for this exact
stack. Component-level data: Milvus benchmarks [\[V\]](benchmarks.md#1-vector-databases),
vLLM 2–4× throughput vs FasterTransformer [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#5-llm-serving),
ANN-Benchmarks [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#1-vector-databases). Enterprise stack
cost depends entirely on cluster sizing — no public reference architecture
pricing exists.*

## Frameworks & Orchestration

### Framework Comparison

Choose the right framework for your use case with this production-focused comparison:

| Framework | Best For | Async Support | Production Readiness | Orchestration Style | Observability | Learning Curve | Deployment Complexity | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) | Data Processing & Indexing | Full | High | Data-Flow Pipelines | Built-in + 3rd Party | Low–Medium | Low | — |
| [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) | Rapid Prototyping | Full | Medium–High | Sequential Chains | Excellent (LangSmith) | Medium | Medium | — |
| [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) | Complex Agents & Control | Full | High | Cyclic Graphs | Excellent (LangSmith) | High | Medium–High | — |
| [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) | Enterprise Pipelines | Full | Very High | DAG-based Pipelines | Built-in Tracing | Medium–High | Low–Medium | — |

**Key Considerations:**

- **LlamaIndex**: Choose if you need advanced indexing strategies (hierarchical, knowledge graphs) and your focus is on data ingestion.
- **LangChain**: Best for quick experiments and maximum ecosystem compatibility. Watch out for abstraction overhead.
- **LangGraph**: Pick this when building agentic systems with human-in-the-loop, state persistence, or cyclic workflows.
- **Haystack**: The enterprise choice for auditable, type-safe pipelines with strict reproducibility requirements.

## Embedding Models

Choosing the right embedding model is one of the highest-leverage decisions in a RAG pipeline — the wrong choice silently degrades retrieval before the LLM ever sees the context.
The [MTEB Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) \[3P\] is the canonical benchmark for retrieval quality (nDCG@10 on BEIR datasets);
see [benchmarks.md §2](benchmarks.md#2-embeddings--retrieval) for a snapshot with source citations.

**Deep dive:** [How to Choose an Embedding Model](embedding-model-selection.md) —
selection criteria, MTEB caveats, dimensionality vs. cost, and when to fine-tune.

| Model | Strengths | Context Window | Hosting | Best For | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [OpenAI text-embedding-3-large](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) | High retrieval nDCG@10 | 8,191 tokens | API | General English retrieval | [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#2-embeddings--retrieval) |
| [Cohere embed-v4](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/cohere-embed) | Multimodal, multilingual, int8 support | 128,000 tokens | API + self-host | Multilingual + cost-efficient | [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#2-embeddings--retrieval) |
| [Voyage voyage-3](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings) | Top MTEB retrieval scores | 32,000 tokens | API | Long-context retrieval | [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#2-embeddings--retrieval) |
| [BAAI BGE-M3](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-m3) | Multi-lingual, multi-granularity | 8,192 tokens | Self-host | Open-weight multilingual | [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#2-embeddings--retrieval) |
| [Nomic nomic-embed-text-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5) | Long context, Apache 2.0 license | 8,192 tokens | Self-host / API | Open, long-context | — |
| [Alibaba gte-multilingual-base](https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-base) | 70+ languages, compact | 8,192 tokens | Self-host | Multilingual, cost-sensitive | — |
| [Jina jina-embeddings-v3](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3) | Task-adaptive LoRA adapters | 8,192 tokens | Self-host / API | Task-specific fine-tuning | — |

**Selection guide:**

- Use **MTEB Retrieval** scores (nDCG@10 on BEIR) as the primary benchmark — not overall MTEB average, which includes tasks irrelevant to RAG.
- For **domain-specific corpora** (legal, medical, code), fine-tune a base model with `sentence-transformers` on your own labeled pairs; generic MTEB rankings will not predict your performance.
- **Always use the same model** for indexing and querying — mismatched models are a silent recall killer (see [rag-pitfalls.md](rag-pitfalls.md#embedding-model-selection)).
- For **multilingual** pipelines: BGE-M3, Cohere embed-v4, or jina-embeddings-v3 with task adapters.

**Trade-offs:**

- API-hosted models (OpenAI, Cohere, Voyage) eliminate GPU ops overhead but create vendor dependency and add per-token costs at scale.
- Self-hosted open models (BGE-M3, nomic-embed) require GPU at production throughput but unlock full data sovereignty.
- Larger context windows (nomic-embed 8k, voyage-3 32k) are critical for long-document retrieval but increase embedding latency and cost per document.

---

## Embedding Fine-tuning

<!-- no-alphabetical -->

Generic MTEB rankings break down on domain-specific corpora (legal, medical, code,
financial). Fine-tuning a base embedding model on your own labeled pairs consistently
outperforms off-the-shelf models for in-domain retrieval — without the cost of
training from scratch. See also: [rag-pitfalls.md — Embedding Model Selection](rag-pitfalls.md#embedding-model-selection).

**When to fine-tune:**

- Off-the-shelf MTEB leaders underperform on your internal evaluation set.
- Your corpus uses specialized terminology not well represented in common pretraining data.
- You have labeled retrieval pairs (query → relevant passage) or can generate them via LLM.

| Tool | Approach | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) | Contrastive / triplet / GISTEmbedLoss fine-tuning | General-purpose; widest community and integration support |
| [FlagEmbedding](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding) | BGE-family fine-tuning + LLAMA-based embeddings | BAAI BGE model variants; includes hard-negative mining utilities |
| [SetFit](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit) | Few-shot contrastive fine-tuning | Low-data regime; strong results with as few as 8 labeled examples per class |
| [Tevatron](https://github.com/texttron/tevatron) | Dense retrieval training framework (bi-encoder + reranker) | Research-grade pipelines; flexible loss functions and BEIR evaluation |
| [RAGatouille](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/RAGatouille) | Late-interaction ColBERT fine-tuning | When token-level late interaction improves recall vs. single-vector embeddings |

- [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers)

## Data & Index Versioning

<!-- no-alphabetical -->

Production RAG indices drift over time: embedding models are upgraded, schema
changes reshape chunk boundaries, and knowledge bases grow. Without versioning,
re-indexing becomes a high-risk, manual operation. These tools bring reproducible,
auditable version control to datasets and vector indices — enabling safe rollbacks
when a model change degrades retrieval quality.

**When you need index versioning:**

- Upgrading embedding models (dimension or tokenizer change requires full re-index).
- Schema migrations that alter chunk boundaries or metadata fields.
- Multi-environment pipelines (dev → staging → prod) requiring consistent index snapshots.
- Audit requirements demanding traceability between document versions and retrieved answers.

| Tool | Focus | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) | Dataset & model versioning (Git-like) | Tracking raw data, embeddings, and model artifacts in a Git-compatible workflow |
| [lakeFS](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS) | Git-for-data on object storage | Branching and merging large datasets on S3/GCS/Azure — zero-copy snapshots |
| [Pachyderm](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm) | Data-versioned pipeline orchestration (upstream stalled since 2025) | End-to-end provenance tracking across ingestion → embedding → index pipelines |
| [Oxen](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen) | Fast dataset version control | ML dataset iteration with commit history, branching, and large-file support |

    vector-native branching (listed in [Vector Databases](#vector-databases)).
- [Pachyderm](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - A data-versioned pipeline orchestration platform. Every pipeline run is
    tied to an immutable data commit, giving full lineage from source document
    to vector index to LLM response — useful in compliance-heavy domains.
    Listed for reference: upstream has had no commits since early 2025 following
    the HPE acquisition. For new pipelines prefer
    [lakeFS](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS) or [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc).
- [Oxen](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen)
  - A fast dataset version control tool optimized for ML workflows. Supports

## Chunking & Document Processing

<!-- no-alphabetical -->

How you split documents into chunks is one of the most underrated decisions in a RAG pipeline.
The wrong chunking strategy silently degrades retrieval quality regardless of how good your embedding model is.
See [rag-pitfalls.md — Fixed Chunk Size Everywhere](rag-pitfalls.md#data-ingestion--chunking) for the failure modes.

**Deep dive:** [Chunking Strategies](chunking-strategies.md) — strategy catalog,
chunk size and overlap, tooling, and how to evaluate chunking on your corpus.

**Chunking strategies at a glance:**

| Strategy | When to Use | Trade-off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fixed-size (token count) | Baseline; simple corpora | Splits mid-sentence/table; safe starting point |
| Recursive character split | General text, mixed formats | Respects paragraph → sentence → word boundaries |
| Semantic chunking | Heterogeneous corpora, varying density | Higher quality; requires an embedding model at index time |
| Document-type aware | PDFs, code, tables, HTML | Best recall; requires per-type parsers |
| Hierarchical / small-to-big | Multi-hop retrieval | Retrieves small chunks, returns parent context to LLM |

- [chonkie](https://github.com/feyninc/chonkie)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-01 -->
  - A fast, lightweight ingestion and chunking library purpose-built for RAG.
    Supports token, sentence, semantic, recursive, and late-chunking strategies
    in a single API with minimal dependencies. Optimized for throughput —
    suitable for batch indexing pipelines.
- [LlamaIndex SemanticSplitterNodeParser](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/node_parsers/modules/)
  - Splits documents at semantically meaningful boundaries by embedding adjacent
    sentences and measuring cosine distance. Produces more coherent chunks than
    fixed-size splitting for narrative and technical content.
- [LangChain RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/recursive_text_splitter/)
  - The de facto default for general-purpose chunking. Recursively tries separators
    (`\n\n`, `\n`, or a space) to split at natural boundaries within a target token
    window — robust, fast, no extra dependencies.
- [semchunk](https://github.com/umarbutler/semchunk)
  - A pure-Python semantic chunking library that requires no embedding model at
    chunk time; it uses statistical sentence boundaries for fast, low-cost semantic
    splitting suitable for large-scale batch indexing.
- [Unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) — see [Data Ingestion & Parsing](#data-ingestion--parsing) for the full entry.
  - Provides document-type aware parsing (PDF, DOCX, HTML, images) as the upstream
    step before chunking. Pair it with any splitter above for a robust ingestion pipeline.

**Trade-offs:**

- Fixed-size chunking is fast and dependency-free but degrades retrieval on tables, code, and structured content.
- Semantic chunking improves recall on heterogeneous corpora but adds embedding cost at index time and is slower.
- Chunk size affects both retrieval recall (too large = coarse matching) and LLM context quality (too small = missing context);
  256–512 tokens is a common starting point — tune on your own corpus with Ragas or DeepEval.

## Retrieval & Reranking

<!-- no-alphabetical -->

**Hybrid Search:**
A retrieval strategy that linearly combines Dense Vector Search (semantic
understanding) with Sparse Keyword Search (BM25 for exact term matching). This
mitigates the "lost in the middle" phenomenon and significantly improves
zero-shot retrieval performance.

- [BGE-Reranker](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3)
  - One of the best open-source rerankers available. It is a cross-encoder model
    trained to output a relevance score for query-document pairs, offering
    commercial-grade performance for self-hosted pipelines.
- [Cohere Rerank](https://cohere.com/rerank)
  - A powerful API-based reranking model. By re-scoring the initial top-K
    documents from a cheaper/faster retriever, it substantially improves retrieval
    precision with minimal code changes. Independent benchmarks show cross-encoder
    rerankers outperform bi-encoders by 4+ nDCG@10 points on BEIR
    (\[3P\] [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#3-reranking)).
- [FlashRank](https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/FlashRank)
  - A lightweight, serverless-friendly reranking library. It runs quantized
    cross-encoder models directly on the CPU (no Torch/GPU required), making it
    ideal for edge deployments or cost-sensitive architectures.
- [PageIndex](https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-01 -->
  - Builds a hierarchical table-of-contents index over long documents and
    navigates it by reasoning instead of vector similarity. Useful where
    chunk-and-embed loses structure — regulatory filings, manuals, contracts —
    and where citing the exact section matters more than nearest-neighbour recall.
- [psql_bm25s](https://github.com/Intelligent-Internet/psql_bm25s)
  <!-- verified: 2026-06-25 -->
  - A PostgreSQL extension for BM25-family lexical retrieval with native indexing
    and SQL top-k query APIs. It can provide the keyword retrieval leg for
    Postgres-based hybrid RAG stacks.
- [RAGatouille](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/RAGatouille)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - A library that makes ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT)
    easy to use. ColBERT offers fine-grained token-level matching, providing
    superior retrieval quality compared to standard single-vector dense
    retrieval. Upstream has been quiet since mid-2025 — pin your version and
    check compatibility before adopting it in a new pipeline.

**GraphRAG:**

An advanced retrieval method that constructs a knowledge graph from documents. It
traverses relationships between entities to answer "global" queries (e.g., "What
are the main themes?") that standard vector search struggles to address.

- [Microsoft GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag)
  - Microsoft Research's production-grade graph-based RAG framework. Builds a
    community-aware knowledge graph from documents, enabling both local
    (entity-centric) and global (theme-level) queries with LLM-generated summaries.
- [nano-graphrag](https://github.com/gusye1234/nano-graphrag)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - A lightweight, hackable implementation of the GraphRAG pipeline (~1k lines).
    Ideal for understanding the algorithm or embedding it into custom systems
    without the full Microsoft GraphRAG dependency footprint. Listed as a
    reference implementation rather than a dependency: it is deliberately small
    and finished, and upstream has been quiet since early 2026.
- [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - Pairs graph traversal with dual-level vector retrieval and supports
    incremental updates and selective deletion, so a changed document does not
    force the full re-indexing pass that batch GraphRAG requires. Runs as a
    server with pluggable production storage (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, MongoDB,
    OpenSearch) and built-in Ragas and Langfuse hooks.
- [LlamaIndex PropertyGraphIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/indexing/lpg_index_guide/)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-01 -->
  - First-class knowledge graph indexing within the LlamaIndex ecosystem, and the
    successor to the older `KnowledgeGraphIndex`. Extracts labelled entities and
    relations from documents via customizable extractors and stores them in graph
    backends (Neo4j, Nebula, TigerGraph) for traversal-based retrieval.
- [Neo4j LLM Knowledge Graph Builder](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/llm-graph-builder)
  - An end-to-end application that extracts knowledge graphs from unstructured
    documents into Neo4j using LLMs. Provides a UI for exploring the resulting
    graph and integrates with LangChain's Neo4j vector + graph retrieval.

**Context Compression:**

Retrieval decides which passages reach the model; compression decides how much of
each one does. A reranker drops whole documents, while a compressor shortens what
survives — stripping boilerplate, repeated JSON keys, and log noise before the
prompt is assembled. It attacks the same context-window and cost pressure from the
opposite end, and the two compose.

- [headroom](https://github.com/headroomlabs-ai/headroom)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - An Apache-2.0 compression layer for everything an agent reads — tool outputs,
    logs, files, and retrieved chunks — shipped as a library, a proxy, and an MCP
    server, so it slots in front of an existing pipeline instead of replacing it.
    Its compressors are content-aware and reversible, and run locally rather than
    calling out to another model.
- [LLMLingua](https://github.com/microsoft/LLMLingua)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - Microsoft Research's prompt-compression family (EMNLP 2023, ACL 2024), which
    uses a small language model to drop low-information tokens from the prompt and
    the KV-cache. The published research lineage makes it the reference point for
    compression quality, though upstream commit activity has slowed — check
    maintenance status before adopting it in a new pipeline.

**Compression trade-offs:**

- Compression is lossy by construction. Measure answer quality on your own eval
  set before and after; published ratios come from someone else's workload, and
  structured data compresses far better than prose.
- Aggressive token removal can strip the exact identifier, figure, or negation a
  grounded answer depends on. Protect quoted spans and citation anchors explicitly.
- Every compressor adds a step in the hot path — latency for all of them, and for
  model-based compressors an additional failure domain in front of the LLM.

## Query Transformation & Routing

<!-- no-alphabetical -->

Raw user queries are rarely optimal for retrieval — they may be ambiguous, contain typos, be too vague, or require multi-hop reasoning.
Query transformation is the pre-retrieval step that rewrites or expands the query to maximize recall.
Query routing dispatches queries to different retrievers or indexes based on intent classification.
See [rag-pitfalls.md — No Query Transformation](rag-pitfalls.md#retrieval-strategy) for the failure mode.

**Core transformation techniques:**

| Technique | What it does | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) | Generate a hypothetical answer, embed it instead of the query | Technical / domain-specific corpora |
| Multi-Query | Generate N paraphrases of the query, retrieve for each, merge results | Broad coverage, handling ambiguity |
| Step-Back Prompting | Ask a more abstract version of the query first, then retrieve | Multi-hop reasoning, "why/how" questions |
| Query Decomposition | Break a complex query into sub-queries, retrieve independently | Comparative and multi-document tasks |
| Query Routing | Classify query intent and dispatch to the appropriate retriever | Multi-index or multi-domain deployments |

- [LlamaIndex Query Transformations](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/deploying/query_engine/)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-01 -->
  - First-class support for HyDE, multi-query, step-back, and sub-question
    decomposition within the LlamaIndex query engine. Each transformation is a
    composable module that slots into existing pipelines without restructuring.
- [LangChain Multi-Query Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/MultiQueryRetriever/)
  - Generates multiple rephrasings of the input query using an LLM, runs each
    against the vector store, and deduplicates results — improving recall for
    ambiguous or under-specified user queries with minimal code.
- [semantic-router](https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router)
  - A high-speed semantic decision layer for routing queries to the appropriate
    retriever, index, or tool. Classifies incoming queries by semantic similarity
    to predefined route examples (no LLM inference required for routing itself).
- [LlamaIndex RouterQueryEngine](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/querying/router/)
  - LLM-powered query router that selects the best retriever or tool from a
    defined set based on query content — suitable for multi-index RAG deployments
    where different document types live in separate stores.

**When to Transform Queries:**

- HyDE: when your corpus is highly technical and query/document vocabulary mismatch degrades recall.
- Multi-Query: when user queries are short or ambiguous and you have headroom for 2–3× retrieval calls.
- Decomposition: when queries require comparing or aggregating information from multiple documents.
- Routing: when you have multiple indexes (e.g., SQL + vector + web search) and want deterministic dispatch.

**Trade-offs:**

- Each transformation adds at least one extra LLM call — latency and cost scale with the number of sub-queries.
- Multi-query and decomposition increase the number of retrieved chunks fed to the reranker; budget for reranker latency accordingly.
- HyDE can introduce hallucinations in the hypothetical document if the generating model is weak; validate recall improvement on your own eval set before committing.

## Agentic RAG

Agentic RAG represents the evolution of traditional RAG systems into autonomous,
decision-making entities. Instead of a simple "retrieve-then-generate" pipeline,
agentic systems can plan multi-step workflows, use tools, and dynamically adjust
their retrieval strategy based on intermediate results.

**Core Capabilities:**

- **Multi-step Reasoning**: Break complex queries into sub-tasks
- **Tool Use**: Integrate external APIs, databases, and services
- **Self-Correction**: Validate retrieved context and retry if needed
- **Planning**: Determine optimal retrieval strategy dynamically

### Frameworks & Tools

- [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)
  - Microsoft's framework for building multi-agent conversational systems. Agents
    can collaborate, debate, and refine answers through back-and-forth dialogue,
    improving output quality through consensus.
- [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)
  - A lightweight framework for orchestrating role-playing autonomous AI agents.
    Define specialized "crew members" (Researcher, Writer, Critic) that work
    together on complex RAG tasks.
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) — see [Frameworks & Orchestration](#frameworks--orchestration) for the full entry.
  - The canonical choice for cyclic, stateful agentic workflows with human-in-the-loop control and memory persistence.
- [OpenAI Responses API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/assistants/migration)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-01 -->
  - A managed service for building agent-like experiences, providing built-in
    retrieval, code interpreter, and function calling with minimal infrastructure
    overhead. Replaces the Assistants API, which sunsets on 2026-08-26 — the
    linked migration guide maps Threads to Conversations and Runs to Responses.
- [RAGFlow](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow) — see [Frameworks & Orchestration](#frameworks--orchestration) for the full entry.
  - Extends the core RAGFlow engine with agentic capabilities: dynamic document re-ranking, query decomposition, and adaptive retrieval strategies based on query complexity.

**When to Use Agentic RAG:**

- Complex, multi-hop questions requiring planning ("Compare X and Y across these 5 documents").
- Integration with external tools (SQL databases, APIs, calculators).
- Tasks requiring validation (fact-checking, citation verification).

**Trade-offs:**

- Higher latency (multiple LLM calls).
- Increased cost (agent reasoning + retrieval).
- Debugging complexity (non-deterministic behavior).

---

## Agent Memory & Stateful Context

Agentic RAG systems are only as useful as their memory.
Without a persistent memory layer, agents lose context between sessions and
cannot learn from past interactions — forcing users to repeat themselves and
preventing the system from adapting to individual preferences or organizational
knowledge. An agent memory store sits alongside the vector retrieval pipeline,
handling *what the agent knows about the user and the world across turns*,
distinct from the RAG knowledge base itself.

**Core Capabilities:**

- **Short-term / in-session context**: Conversation buffer and working memory across a single session.
- **Long-term / cross-session memory**: Persisting facts, preferences, and history across conversations.
- **Temporal consistency**: Handling conflicting or outdated facts as knowledge changes over time.
- **Multi-agent memory sharing**: Allowing specialized agents within a crew to read from and write to a shared memory store.

### Frameworks & Tools

- [LangMem](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langmem)
  - LangChain's native memory SDK for building agents with persistent, long-term
    memory. Integrates directly with LangGraph state and LangSmith tracing,
    enabling structured and semantic memory stores with minimal boilerplate.
- [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta)
  - The production evolution of MemGPT. Provides agents with persistent,
    editable memory stored as structured context windows — the agent can
    consciously read, write, and summarize its own memory as part of its
    reasoning loop.
- [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)
  - A universal memory layer for AI agents that extracts and stores salient
    facts from every conversation turn. Provides a unified API across
    graph-based, vector, and key-value backends; selected as the memory
    provider in the AWS Agent SDK.
- [Vestige](https://github.com/samvallad33/vestige)
  <!-- verified: 2026-06-26 -->
  - Local-first memory MCP server for coding agents, written in Rust with a
    SQLite store. Uses FSRS-6 retention scheduling, prediction-error gating on
    writes, spreading activation, and hybrid retrieval, and exposes provenance
    and correction tools over MCP for Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and Codex.
- [Zep / Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti)
  - Zep builds a temporal knowledge graph (Graphiti) where every stored fact
    carries a validity window. Conflicting facts are not stacked — the older
    assertion is automatically invalidated when new information supersedes it,
    returning only the current truth on retrieval.

**When to Add a Memory Layer:**

- Conversational assistants where users expect context to carry over across sessions.
- Workflows where an agent must track evolving state (project status, user preferences, organizational decisions).
- Multi-agent pipelines where specialized agents must share a consistent world-model.

**Trade-offs:**

- Memory extraction adds latency proportional to the extraction model size; budget an extra LLM call per turn.
- Persistent memory stores require a privacy and data-retention policy — storing personal facts across sessions is subject to GDPR / CCPA depending on jurisdiction.
- Temporal consistency (Zep/Graphiti approach) requires graph infrastructure; simpler vector-based stores (Mem0) are faster to deploy but may surface stale facts under rapid knowledge change.

## Multimodal RAG

Production RAG increasingly operates on documents that combine text, images,
tables, and charts — financial reports, technical manuals, and product catalogs
that defeat pure-text chunking. Multimodal RAG extends classical retrieval by
embedding and querying across modalities in a shared vector space, or by treating
document pages as images (ColPali-style), bypassing the OCR → chunk → embed
pipeline and preserving layout information that text extraction destroys.

**Core Capabilities:**

- **Vision-document retrieval**: Index full document pages as images; retrieve
  without OCR pre-processing, preserving tables, charts, and diagrams
- **Aligned text/image embedding spaces**: Represent queries and mixed documents
  in a shared vector space for cross-modal search
- **Cross-modal queries**: A text query retrieves image results and vice versa
- **Layout-aware understanding**: Figures, schematics, and tables are searchable
  by their visual content, not just surrounding text

- [Voyage Multimodal-3](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/multimodal-embeddings)
  - A managed API for embedding interleaved text-and-image documents (e.g., PDFs
    with inline figures). A single API call embeds a mixed document page as one
    vector, slotting into existing retrieval pipelines with minimal code changes.

**When to Use Multimodal RAG:**

- Documents with complex layouts: financial reports, scientific papers, or
  technical schematics where tables and charts carry critical information.
- Product catalogs and e-commerce: image-to-image or text-to-image queries.
- Screenshot or UI documentation retrieval where text extraction is noisy.
- Medical imaging paired with reports — query by image or clinical description.

**Trade-offs:**

- Storage overhead: multi-vector page-image indexes are substantially larger
  than text-chunk indexes (ColPali: ~257.5 KB/page at D=128 vs. ~6 KB/vector for
  standard text embeddings — \[3P\] [ColPali paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01449),
  ICLR 2025); plan for object storage and increased embedding costs.
- GPU requirements: vision encoders and ColPali-style late interaction require
  GPU for production throughput; CPU-only deployments face significant latency.
- Evaluation complexity: no universal benchmark for domain-specific multimodal
  retrieval quality — custom human annotation sets are required.

## Structured & SQL RAG

Classical RAG retrieves unstructured text chunks. Structured RAG extends this
to tables, databases, and business data stores — where the "retrieval" step is a
generated SQL or analytics query, not a vector similarity search.
This approach is critical for enterprise applications where the source of truth
lives in relational databases, data warehouses, or spreadsheets rather than
document collections.

**Core Capabilities:**

- **Text-to-SQL generation**: Translate natural language questions into executable SQL.
- **Schema-aware retrieval**: Incorporate table schemas, relationships, and business semantics into the prompt context to reduce hallucinated column names.
- **Hybrid structured + unstructured**: Combine SQL retrieval over structured data with vector search over accompanying text documents (e.g., financial reports with embedded narratives).

### Frameworks & Tools

- [Vanna](https://github.com/vanna-ai/vanna)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - A Python framework for accurate Text-to-SQL generation using LLMs with
    agentic retrieval. It trains a retrieval model on your schema, DDL, and
    prior question-SQL pairs so queries stay faithful to the actual database
    structure rather than hallucinating columns or table names. The repository
    was archived in February 2026 immediately after the 2.0 release, with no
    successor named; the code is MIT and still installable, but it will not
    receive fixes. For new work prefer [WrenAI](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI).
- [WrenAI](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI)
  - An open-source context layer that enriches SQL generation with business
    semantics, examples, and governance rules — enabling AI agents to query
    across 20+ data sources accurately without schema-only prompting.

**When to Use Structured RAG:**

- Your knowledge base lives primarily in relational databases, data warehouses, or spreadsheets.
- Business users need natural-language queries over metrics, KPIs, or transaction data.
- Accuracy on column names and aggregations is critical (hallucinated SQL is dangerous in production).

**Trade-offs:**

- Schema changes require re-training or re-prompting the retrieval model — tighter coupling to the data layer than unstructured RAG.
- Security surface is larger: a well-crafted prompt can generate destructive SQL (always run generated queries in a read-only role).
- Multi-table joins and complex aggregations remain challenging; validate on your own schema complexity before committing.

## Evaluation & Benchmarking

Reliable RAG requires measuring the **RAG Triad**: Context Relevance,
Groundedness, and Answer Relevance.

- [Braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev/)
  - An enterprise-grade platform for evaluating and logging LLM outputs. It
    excels at "Online Evaluation," allowing you to score real-world user
    interactions and feed that data back into your development set.
- [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)
  - The "Pytest for LLMs". It offers a unit-testing framework for RAG,
    integrating seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines to catch regressions in retrieval
    quality or hallucination rates before deployment.
- [KB Arena](https://github.com/xmpuspus/kb-arena)
  <!-- verified: 2026-06-25 -->
  - Benchmarks 9 retrieval architectures (naive vector, contextual vector, QnA
    pairs, knowledge graph, hybrid RRF, RAPTOR, PageIndex, BM25, rerank) on
    your own corpus with statistical IR metrics (Recall/NDCG/MAP/bpref) plus
    paired-bootstrap CIs and Wilcoxon p-values to call architectural winners
    with confidence before you commit infrastructure.
- [promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - Declarative, config-driven evals that run from the CLI and in CI/CD, so a
    prompt or model change is gated by assertions instead of eyeballed in a
    notebook. It also ships adversarial red-teaming and vulnerability scanning,
    covering the security half of RAG evaluation that quality metrics alone miss.
- [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)
  - A framework that uses an "LLM-as-a-Judge" to evaluate your pipeline. It
    calculates metrics like Faithfulness (did the answer come from the context?)
    and Answer Relevance without needing human-labeled ground truth.
- [TruLens](https://github.com/truera/trulens)
  - The library that introduced the RAG Triad (context relevance, groundedness,
    answer relevance) as a systematic evaluation framework. It wraps LangChain,
    LlamaIndex, and DSPy pipelines with feedback functions that score each
    retrieval-and-generation step, emitting OpenTelemetry traces for both
    development debugging and production monitoring.
- [Verbatim Citation Gate](https://github.com/Palo-Alto-AI-Research-Lab/verbatim-citation-gate)
  <!-- verified: 2026-07-28 -->
  - Catches fabricated citations before the answer reaches the user by first
    checking, with no LLM call, that every quoted span appears verbatim in the
    retrieved context, then escalating only the survivors to a burden-of-proof
    judge. Framework-agnostic, so it drops in front of an existing pipeline
    rather than replacing its evaluator.

### LLM-as-Judge Evaluation

Using one LLM to evaluate the outputs of another has become a standard practice in production RAG systems.
This approach scales better than human evaluation and provides consistent, automated quality assessment.

**Core Frameworks:**

- [ARES (Automated RAG Evaluation System)](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ARES)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - Stanford's research project that fine-tunes small LLMs as judges specifically
    for RAG evaluation, targeting frontier-model judge accuracy at a fraction of
    the cost. A research codebase — upstream activity has been sparse since 2025;
    treat it as a reference implementation rather than a maintained dependency.
- [AutoEvals](https://github.com/braintrustdata/autoevals)
  - A tool for quickly and easily evaluating AI model outputs using best
    practices, including LLM-as-a-judge and heuristic methods.
- [G-Eval](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-01 -->
  - A framework that uses an LLM with chain-of-thought reasoning to evaluate text
    generation quality, reporting human-level correlation on summarization and
    dialogue tasks. The link points to DeepEval's maintained implementation; the
    original research repo (`nlpyang/geval`) is no longer updated.
- [LangChain Evaluators](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview)
  - Built-in evaluation chains for criteria-based scoring, pairwise comparison,
    and embedding distance. Seamlessly integrates with LangSmith for
    production monitoring.
- [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-eval/prometheus-eval)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - An open-source LLM specifically trained for evaluation tasks. Unlike calling a
    frontier model as a judge, Prometheus is optimized for scoring consistency and
    can run locally for cost-sensitive deployments. Use the `prometheus-eval`
    repository — the original `prometheus` repo has had no commits since 2023.
    Note that `prometheus-eval` has itself been quiet since mid-2025; the
    released model weights remain usable, but treat the harness as a research
    artifact rather than a maintained dependency.

**Key Metrics:**

| Metric | What It Measures | Judge LLM Prompt Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Faithfulness** | Does the answer come from the retrieved context? | "Does the answer contain information not in the context? Yes/No" |
| **Answer Relevance** | Does the answer address the question? | "Rate how well this answer addresses the question (1-5)" |
| **Context Precision** | Are the top-ranked chunks actually relevant? | "Is this passage relevant to answering the question? Yes/No" |
| **Context Recall** | Did we retrieve all necessary information? | "Is there missing information needed to answer this question?" |

**Best Practices:**

- Use current frontier models for critical evaluations — highest agreement with humans.
- Fine-tune smaller open-weight models (7–8B class) as judges for cost/latency optimization.
- Chain-of-Thought prompting improves judge consistency and human alignment (G-Eval, EACL 2024).
- Always validate judge performance against human labels on a sample (100–200 examples).
- Be aware of position bias — LLMs tend to favor earlier options in pairwise comparisons.
- LLM judges can inherit biases from their training data; audit regularly.

## Observability & Tracing

- [Arize Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix)
  - A tool specifically designed for troubleshooting retrieval issues. It
    visualizes your embedding clusters and retrieved document rankings, helping
    you understand *why* the model retrieved irrelevant context.
- [Future AGI](https://github.com/future-agi/future-agi)
  <!-- verified: 2026-06-25 -->
  - Open-source platform for evaluating, tracing, and guardrailing RAG and agent
    apps. Captures OpenTelemetry-native traces, runs 70+ eval metrics and
    LLM-as-judge for retrieval and answer quality, and adds runtime guardrails
    for hallucination, PII, and prompt injection. Self-hostable. Apache-2.0.
- [Langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)
  - An open-source engineering platform for LLM observability. It captures full
    execution traces (latency, token usage, cost) and allows for "Prompt
    Management," letting you version-control prompts decoupled from your code.
- [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith/observability)
  - Built by the LangChain team, this is the gold standard for debugging complex
    chains. It provides a "Playground" to rerun specific traces with modified
    prompts to iterate on edge cases instantly.
- [OpenLIT](https://github.com/openlit/openlit)
  - An OpenTelemetry-native monitoring solution. If you already use
    Prometheus/Grafana or Datadog, OpenLIT drops into your existing stack to
    provide standardized LLM metrics (GPU usage, token throughput).
- [Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik)
  - Comet's open-source platform for end-to-end LLM, RAG, and agent
    observability. Captures full execution traces, runs automated evaluations
    against built-in and custom metrics, and surfaces production dashboards
    for cost, latency, and quality — all in a single self-hostable service.
- [OrcaReplay](https://github.com/Continuum-AI-Corp/OrcaReplay)
  - Records a RAG or agent run at the model-provider HTTP boundary from outside
    the process — verbatim requests and responses, tool calls, and file changes
    — then serves the recording back so the same run executes again with no
    provider called. Where the tools above give you a trace to read, this gives
    you one you can re-run: a production failure becomes a fixture a colleague
    can reproduce with no API key. Nothing is imported into your app. Apache-2.0.

## Deployment & Serving

- [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)
  - A framework for packaging models into standardized APIs (Bentos). It handles
    the complexity of adaptive batching and multi-model serving, allowing you to
    deploy any model to any cloud (AWS Lambda, EC2, Kubernetes) with one
    command.
- [KServe](https://github.com/kserve/kserve)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-01 -->
  - Kubernetes-native model serving with a standard inference protocol. Provides
    autoscaling (including scale-to-zero), canary rollouts, and an inference
    graph for chaining retriever, reranker, and generator as separate services.
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
  - The easiest way to run LLMs locally. While primarily for dev/local use, it
    bridges the gap between local testing and deployment by providing a standard
    API for open-weight models.
- [Ray Serve](https://github.com/ray-project/ray)
  - The industry standard for scaling Python ML workloads. It allows you to
    compose complex pipelines (e.g., Retriever + Reranker + LLM) where each
    component scales independently across a cluster of machines.
- [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-01 -->
  - Runs inference and indexing jobs across clouds and Kubernetes from one
    spec, picking the cheapest available region and recovering from spot
    preemptions automatically — the practical lever for GPU cost on
    self-hosted RAG serving.
- [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-01 -->
  - NVIDIA's production inference server. Serves embedding, reranking, and
    generation models side by side from one process with dynamic batching and
    concurrent model execution, so a RAG pipeline's several models share GPUs
    instead of each holding their own.
- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
  - A high-performance inference engine known for PagedAttention. It maximizes
    GPU memory utilization, allowing you to serve larger models or handle higher
    concurrency with lower latency than standard Hugging Face Transformers.
    PagedAttention delivers 2–4× throughput improvement at the same latency SLO
    (\[3P\] [Kwon et al., SOSP 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180)).

## Caching & Performance

Caching is one of the highest-leverage optimizations in production RAG: it
directly reduces cost, cuts p99 latency, and absorbs traffic spikes without
scaling infrastructure. Four distinct cache layers exist, each targeting a
different bottleneck — deploying them in combination yields compounding returns.

**Cache Layers:**

- **Exact-match** — key-value lookup on the full prompt string; instant but only
  hits on byte-identical queries
- **Semantic** — vector similarity search over recent queries; higher hit-rate
  at the cost of a tuned similarity threshold to control false positives
- **Prompt-prefix / Provider-side** — automatic caching of shared context
  prefixes at the LLM provider level (Anthropic, OpenAI); no code changes,
  up to 90% token cost reduction on long shared prefixes
  (\[V\] [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#4-caching-prompt--semantic))
- **KV-cache / Prefix caching** — inference-engine-level attention state reuse
  (vLLM, SGLang) for self-hosted models with repeated system prompts

| Tool | Cache Type | Layer | Backend | Best For | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Anthropic Prompt Caching](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) | Prompt prefix | Provider | Anthropic infra | Long system prompts, large contexts | [\[V\]](benchmarks.md#4-caching-prompt--semantic) |
| [GPTCache](https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCache) | Exact + Semantic | Application | Redis / Milvus / SQLite | Reducing duplicate LLM calls | — |

| [vLLM Automatic Prefix Caching](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/automatic_prefix_caching.html) | KV-cache | Inference engine | GPU memory | Self-hosted RAG, shared system prompts | [\[3P\]](benchmarks.md#5-llm-serving) |

### Tools

- [Anthropic Prompt Caching](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - Provider-side prefix cache for Claude models that bills cache reads at about
    10% of the standard input price
    (\[V\] [Anthropic docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) · 2026-08-01).
    Add a `cache_control` breakpoint in the API request — no infrastructure
    changes required. Cache writes carry a premium, so the break-even point is
    the second read on a 5-minute TTL and the third on a 1-hour TTL.
- [GPTCache](https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCache)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - A widely referenced open-source semantic cache for LLM applications. It
    intercepts LLM calls, runs similarity search over a cache store, and returns
    hits without calling the model — with pluggable similarity functions, eviction
    policies, and storage backends (Redis, Milvus, SQLite). Upstream has had no
    commits since mid-2025 and no release since 2024-08; verify maintenance
    status before adopting.
- [LangChain Cache](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llm_caching/)
  - Built-in exact-match and semantic LLM caching across a broad backend matrix
    (in-memory, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, Cassandra, GPTCache). One-line setup for
    LangChain-native pipelines with no architecture changes.
- [LiteLLM Cache](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/caching)
  - Gateway-level caching across 100+ LLM providers with per-route TTL control,
    Redis/S3/Disk backends, and cache-control headers. Pairs with the LiteLLM
    proxy for a unified cost-management and caching layer.
- [OpenAI Prompt Caching](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/prompt-caching)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - Automatic prefix caching for GPT-4o and o-series models; requires zero code
    changes and delivered a 50% input-token discount on cache hits at launch
    (\[V\] [OpenAI announcement](https://openai.com/index/api-prompt-caching/) · 2024-10),
    though current docs state the discount varies by model. Effective when system
    prompts or retrieved context blocks exceed 1,024 tokens.
- [RedisVL Semantic Cache](https://github.com/redis/redis-vl-python)
  - A Redis Stack–backed semantic cache library with sub-millisecond lookup
    latency. Leverages Redis Vector Sets for similarity search and supports
    configurable thresholds, TTL, and integration with existing Redis
    infrastructure.
- [vLLM Automatic Prefix Caching](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/automatic_prefix_caching.html)
  - Server-side KV-cache reuse that detects shared prompt prefixes across requests
    and reuses their computed attention states. Significant throughput and latency
    gains for self-hosted RAG deployments where a long system prompt is repeated
    across all queries.

**When to Cache What:**

- **Exact-match** — for FAQ bots and narrow-domain assistants with high query repetition (support portals, internal knowledge bases).
- **Semantic** — for general Q&A where phrasing varies but intent repeats (e.g., "What is the refund policy?" ≈ "How do I get a refund?").
- **Prompt-prefix** — whenever system prompts or retrieved contexts exceed 1,024 tokens; activate Anthropic or OpenAI prompt caching for instant cost savings (\[V\] [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#4-caching-prompt--semantic)).
- **KV-cache** — for self-hosted inference where the same system prompt is prepended to every request; configure vLLM's APC for immediate throughput gains.

**Trade-offs:**

- **Staleness**: Cached responses become outdated when the underlying knowledge base changes; design TTL and invalidation strategies alongside cache deployment.
- **Semantic false positives**: Similarity-based hits may return answers to slightly different questions; tune thresholds per domain and monitor hit quality.
- **Observability complexity**: Multi-layer caching obscures which layer served a response; instrument cache hit/miss metrics per layer for meaningful cost and latency attribution.

## Security & Compliance

- [Lakera Guard](https://www.lakera.ai/)
  - A low-latency security API that protects applications against prompt
    injections, data leakage, and toxic content in real-time. It acts as an
    "Application Firewall" for your LLM.
- [LLM Guard](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard)
  - A comprehensive toolkit for sanitizing inputs and outputs. It detects
    invisible text, prompt injections, and anonymizes sensitive data, ensuring
    full compliance with data privacy standards.
- [NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails)
  - The standard for adding programmable guardrails to LLM-based conversational
    systems. It prevents "Jailbreaking" and ensures models stay on topic,
    critical for enterprise chatbots.
- [Presidio](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio)
  - Microsoft’s SDK for PII (Personally Identifiable Information) detection and
    redaction. It ensures sensitive user data (credit cards, emails) is scrubbed
    *before* it hits the embedding model or vector DB.
- [PrivateGPT](https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt)
  - A production-ready project that allows you to run RAG pipelines completely
    offline. It ensures full data privacy by keeping all ingestion and inference
    local, perfect for highly regulated industries.

## LLM Gateways & Routing

<!-- no-alphabetical -->

An LLM gateway sits between your application and one or more LLM providers.
It centralizes authentication, enforces rate limits, aggregates cost metrics, enables provider failover,
and often layers caching on top — without requiring per-provider changes to application code.

| Tool | Hosting | Provider Support | Caching | Cost Tracking | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) | Self-host / Cloud | 100+ providers | Redis / S3 / Disk | Built-in | Multi-provider routing, OpenAI-compatible proxy |
| [Portkey](https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway) | Self-host / Cloud | 200+ providers | Built-in | Dashboard | Enterprise gateway with observability |
| [Bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost) | Self-host | 23+ providers | Semantic | Built-in | Self-hosted routing, failover, and governance |
| [Helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone) | Self-host / Cloud | OpenAI + Anthropic | Built-in | Fine-grained token analytics | Cost optimization and prompt versioning |
| [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) | Managed | 100+ models | — | Per-request | Unified model marketplace, no infra |
| [Cloudflare AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) | Managed (edge) | Major providers | Built-in | Real-time analytics | Edge-deployed, global routing |

- [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)
  - An OpenAI-compatible proxy and SDK wrapper supporting 100+ LLM providers
    (Anthropic, Bedrock, Azure, Gemini, local models via Ollama) with a single
    API surface. Includes gateway-level caching, per-route rate limits, fallback
    routing, and a cost dashboard. The most widely adopted open-source gateway.
- [Portkey AI Gateway](https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway)
  - A high-performance open-source gateway with provider failover, load balancing,
    semantic caching, and virtual API keys. Supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints
    for 200+ providers and integrates with LangChain, LlamaIndex, and raw SDKs.
- [Bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost)
  <!-- verified: 2026-09-02 -->
  - An Apache-2.0, self-hosted AI gateway for multi-provider routing, failover,
    load balancing, observability, guardrails, and budget controls.
- [Helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone)
  - A developer-first observability and gateway platform. One-line integration
    (change base URL) adds token-level cost tracking, latency dashboards, prompt
    versioning, and caching — without any SDK changes. Particularly strong on cost
    attribution per user, team, or feature.
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
  - A managed model marketplace routing requests to 100+ open and proprietary
    models. Provides unified billing, automatic fallback, and model comparison
    without running any infrastructure — best for prototyping or multi-model
    evaluation.
- [Cloudflare AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/)
  - An edge-deployed LLM gateway integrated into the Cloudflare network. Adds
    caching, rate limiting, and real-time analytics with sub-millisecond routing
    overhead; suitable for globally distributed applications where gateway latency
    is a constraint.

**When to Use an LLM Gateway:**

- Multi-provider deployments requiring failover (primary → fallback on 5xx or rate-limit).
- Centralized cost attribution across teams, features, or customers — critical for unit economics.
- Enforcing per-user or per-route rate limits without embedding this logic in every microservice.
- Caching at the gateway layer to complement application-level caches (see [Caching & Performance](#caching--performance)).

**Trade-offs:**

- Self-hosted gateways (LiteLLM, Portkey) add an extra network hop and a component to operate; invest in HA deployment if you route all traffic through them.
- Managed gateways (OpenRouter, Cloudflare) simplify ops but add another vendor dependency and may introduce latency for non-edge traffic.
- Gateway-level semantic caching has the same false-positive risk as application-level caching — tune thresholds carefully.

## FinOps & Cost Management

<!-- no-alphabetical -->

Inference cost is often the largest operational expense in a production RAG system,
yet it is frequently treated as an afterthought. FinOps for RAG means quantifying
token spend per request, attributing costs to features or user segments, and
choosing the right optimization levers (caching, model routing, chunking strategy)
before — not after — cost becomes a budget crisis.

**Key cost levers:**

- **Token counting & estimation** — size prompts and retrieved context before sending
  to an LLM to catch runaway costs early.
- **Prompt + semantic caching** — the highest-ROI optimization; see
  [Caching & Performance](#caching--performance).
- **Model routing** — route simple queries to cheaper models (e.g., Haiku, Gemini Flash)
  via an LLM gateway; see [LLM Gateways & Routing](#llm-gateways--routing).
- **Usage metering** — per-user / per-feature cost attribution enables chargeback,
  quota enforcement, and cost anomaly detection.

| Tool | Focus | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [tokencost](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/tokencost) | Token counting & cost lookup | Pre-flight cost estimates across 400+ LLM models without a live API call |
| [OpenMeter](https://github.com/openmeterio/openmeter) | Usage metering & billing | Per-user / per-feature metering with Stripe integration for usage-based billing |
| [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) | Gateway-level cost tracking | Multi-provider cost dashboard + per-route spend limits (see [LLM Gateways](#llm-gateways--routing)) |
| [Helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone) | Observability + cost attribution | Fine-grained token analytics per user, team, or feature (see [LLM Gateways](#llm-gateways--routing)) |

- [tokencost](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/tokencost)
  <!-- verified: 2026-08-21 -->
  - A lightweight Python library that counts tokens and looks up the
    price-per-token for 400+ LLM models without making a live API call. Useful
    for pre-flight cost estimation in CI pipelines, budget guardrails, and
    prompt optimization loops — ensure a context window fits a cost budget
    before it reaches production. Its last release was 2025-08 and upstream has
    been quiet since; a bundled price table that stops tracking provider pricing
    is worse than no table, so verify the models you care about against current
    provider pricing before trusting a budget guardrail built on it.
- [OpenMeter](https://github.com/openmeterio/openmeter)
  - An open-source usage metering and billing platform. Ingests usage events
    (token counts, API calls, compute seconds) and exposes per-customer,
    per-feature aggregates — with Stripe integration for usage-based billing.
    Critical for SaaS RAG products that need chargeback or quota enforcement
    at the customer level.

**Unit economics checklist:**

- Establish a cost-per-query baseline before optimizing (use tokencost or gateway dashboards).
- Set per-route spend limits in your LLM gateway to catch prompt-injection-driven cost spikes.
- Monitor p95 context window size — retrieval bloat is the most common cause of unexpected spend.
- Cache aggressively: even a 20% semantic cache hit rate can halve LLM call volume at steady state.

## Tutorials & Hands-on Code

The resources below complement this list with **runnable code** — Jupyter notebooks
and annotated examples that walk through the techniques described above end to end.
They are the fastest path from reading about a pattern to having it running in your
own environment.

- [lancedb/vectordb-recipes](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes)
  - A large collection of examples and tutorials covering multimodal RAG, agent
    patterns, and vector search use cases — each backed by a runnable notebook
    or script and organized by task rather than by tool.
- [NirDiamant/Agent_Memory_Techniques](https://github.com/NirDiamant/Agent_Memory_Techniques)
  - Thirty runnable Jupyter notebooks covering the full agent memory spectrum:
    conversation buffers, vector stores, knowledge graphs, episodic and semantic
    memory, Mem0, Letta, Zep, Graphiti, and production memory patterns.
- [NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques](https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques)
  - A comprehensive notebook series covering advanced RAG techniques end to end —
    from adaptive retrieval and hybrid search to corrective RAG, self-RAG, and
    agentic pipelines — with annotated, runnable code for each pattern.

## Selection Criteria

To keep this list high-quality, we only include resources that are:

**1. Production-Ready:** Battle-tested in real-world environments.

**2. Actively Maintained:** Regular updates within the last 3-6 months.

**3. Documented:** Strong API references and clear use cases.

**4. Evidence-backed (for numeric claims):** Any performance or quality claim
(latency, recall, cost reduction, etc.) must carry a source URL, date, and
evidence tag (`[3P]`, `[V]`, or `[A]`). Unsourced numbers belong in
[benchmarks.md § Gaps](benchmarks.md#9-gaps--not-publicly-measured), not in
the list itself.
